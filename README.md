Anonymous analytics and url shortening for users you love.  Track pages, not people.

❤️-based.  Know what your visitors _loved_, not just what they saw.

Generate short urls that don't track who's clicking them.

Analytics without creepy tracking, but with the ability to tell you what people really loved.

No logins.  No cookies.  No GDPR problems and no silly cookie popups.  

Everything encrypted, nothing shared with third parties.

Welcome to a friendlier future.
